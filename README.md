# website-theodinproject
A simple landing page created as a final step in the css and html learning path. 

My design does not exactly follow the guidelines, however I felt the provided design could be improved and I decided to do so.

The Website showcases an example landing page for a Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

This is the last step of the HTML & CSS part in the Foundations learning path of The Odin Project. 

## Figma mokcup I created for the purpose of this project.
