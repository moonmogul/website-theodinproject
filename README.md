# website-theodinproject
A simple landing page created as a final step in the css and html learning path. 

My design does not exactly follow the guidelines, however I felt the provided design could be improved and I decided to do so.

As I have background in no-code dev with Webflow and Framer I have decided to follow the Client-First website structure by Finsweet. It is a set of guidelines that streamlines the process of web development. You can access it under this link https://finsweet.com/client-first.

The Website showcases an example landing page for a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). As I learn Web Dev I am planninig on adding additional compontens to the app. 

This is the last step of the HTML & CSS part in the Foundations learning path of The Odin Project. 

## Figma mokcup I created for the purpose of this project.
